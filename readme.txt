Events Handler enables to manage events and future happenings and show them on your wordpress site.

== Description ==

The plugin features a straight forward user interface in the Wordpress dashboard to add/edit and delete events and set some options. 
Events allows you to list Events on a seperate page or in the sidebar, or both. Here you can list Old (archived) events future events and if you want, events happening today.
When you create or edit an event you can set it to be archived. So that it remains listed. Optionally non-archived events are automatically deleted one day (24 hours) after they expire.
